# The Mirror Gate: Reverse the Word
# This challenge is worth 9 points.

# Write a function called reverse_word(text) that
# - Accepts a string
# - Returns the string reversed
# Example: "hello" â†’ "olleh"


def reverse_word(text):
    # TODO: Add a for loop here.
    # Inside the loop, add each character to 'reversed_text'.

# Sample calls (uncomment to test your code):
print(reverse_word("hello"))      # "olleh"
print(reverse_word("Python"))     # "nohtyP"
print(reverse_word("racecar"))    # "racecar"

# The Cipher Beyond: Password Strength
# This challenge is worth 12 points.

# Write a function called check_password_strength(password) that
# - Accepts a string
# - Returns "weak", "medium", or "strong" based on these rules:
#   * "weak" â†’ fewer than 6 characters
#   * "medium" â†’ at least 6 characters with letters and numbers
#   * "strong" â†’ at least 8 characters, letters, numbers, and a special symbol
